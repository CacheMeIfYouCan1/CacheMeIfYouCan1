# CacheMeIfYouCan1

Hello and welcome, this is the repo for my developer portfolio, which can be found here: https://cache-me.net. Feel free to reach out. I am also currently freelancing for https://vibe-check.net.


PS: The name is inspired by the iconic movie 'Catch Me If You Can', which highlights the dangers of trusting information, even if it seems to be authentic and verfied. This is especially relevant today.
